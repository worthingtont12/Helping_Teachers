# Helping_Teachers
Python scripts to automate the mundane and repetitive tasks teachers have.

# Missing Grades
This script is tailored to teachers who use Infinite Campus. It loops through all the students grades checking for missing assignments. If a student has missing assignments it emails out a list and count of these assignments to the childs first contact. This allows the teacher and parents/guadians to stay in contact with one another in a way that isn't time consuming for the teacher.
